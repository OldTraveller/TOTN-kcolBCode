USAGE OF FILE HANDLING CONCEPTS !! 
ifstream - For Reading Inputs from the File.
ofstream - For Writing to the File.
fstream - For both reading or Writing. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generally prefer the one which is used for what !! (Dont use fstream unless required) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before any operation we need to open the file !! 
For opening the file we make use  of the open function. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYNTAX : open(filename, mode) 
ios::in => Open for input operations.
ios::out => Open for output operations.
ios::binary => Open in binary mode.
ios::ate =>	Set the initial position at the end of the file. If this flag 
            is not set, the initial position is the beginning of the file.
ios::app => All output operations are performed at the end of the file, 
            appending the content to the current content of the file.
ios::trunc => If the file is opened for output operations and it already 
              existed, its previous content is deleted and replaced by the new one.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After all the operations we need to close the files so that the Operating System is notified about 
it and the resources being captured by it are available to use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to get and print each and every line we use something like - 
string line; 
fin.getline(file, line);

These are some helpers, that might be useful.

The goal of this project is to make a test case generator for competitive programming problems. 
As of now the main motive is to make a console based application, which can later be turned to an android application 
or a desktop application. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input should be of the form : 
[ Total Number of test cases desired ] 

[ How many lines of random numbers are desired ]
[ How many random numbers in first line ] [ lower_bound ] [ upper_bound ] 
[ ..... nth line ]
